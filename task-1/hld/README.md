## 1. System Overview

The autonomous delivery fleet system is designed as a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant architecture that manages self-driving vehicles for package delivery. The system is built using microservices architecture to ensure high availability and scalability.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Fleet Management Service

- **Purpose**: Manages the entire fleet of autonomous vehicles
- **Key Features**:
  - Vehicle registration and tracking
  - Route optimization
  - Maintenance scheduling
  - Real-time status monitoring
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL

### 2.2 Vehicle Communication Service

- **Purpose**: Handles all vehicle-to-cloud communication
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time telemetry data collection
  - OTA updates distribution
  - Remote diagnostics
  - Emergency protocols
- **Technologies**: MQTT, Kafka, Node.js

### 2.3 Route Optimization Service

- **Purpose**: Optimizes delivery routes based on multiple factors
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time traffic integration
  - Weather conditions consideration
  - Package priority handling
  - Dynamic route updates
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Google Maps API, Redis

### 2.4 Customer Service

- **Purpose**: Manages customer interactions and notifications
- **Key Features**:
  - Delivery tracking
  - Notification management
  - Customer preferences
  - Feedback collection
- **Technologies**: React, TypeScript, Twilio, SendGrid

### 2.5 Operations Center

- **Purpose**: Provides real-time monitoring and control
- **Key Features**:
  - Dashboard for fleet status
  - Incident management
  - Performance analytics
  - Human intervention coordination
- **Technologies**: React, Grafana, Prometheus

## 3. Data Flow

1. **Package Assignment Flow**:

   ```
   Customer Order → Route Optimization → Vehicle Assignment → Delivery Execution
   ```

2. **Vehicle Communication Flow**:

   ```
   Vehicle Telemetry → MQTT → Kafka → Processing → Storage/Analytics
   ```

3. **Notification Flow**:
   ```
   Event Trigger → Notification Service → Multiple Channels (SMS/Email/Push)
   ```
