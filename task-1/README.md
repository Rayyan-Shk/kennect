- Safety protocols
- Privacy policies
- Data protection measures
- Regulatory requirements

## System Architecture

The system is designed as a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant architecture that manages self-driving vehicles for package delivery. It uses a microservices architecture to ensure high availability and scalability.

### Core Components

1. **Fleet Management Service**

   - Vehicle registration and tracking
   - Route optimization
   - Maintenance scheduling
   - Real-time status monitoring

2. **Vehicle Communication Service**

   - Real-time telemetry data collection
   - OTA updates distribution
   - Remote diagnostics
   - Emergency protocols

3. **Route Optimization Service**

   - Real-time traffic integration
   - Weather conditions consideration
   - Package priority handling
   - Dynamic route updates

4. **Customer Service**
   - Delivery tracking
   - Notification management
   - Customer preferences
   - Feedback collection

### Communication Architecture

The system uses a hybrid communication approach:

- MQTT for vehicle-to-cloud communication
- Kafka for message processing and persistence
- WebSocket for real-time web client updates

### Data Flow

1. **Package Assignment Flow**

   ```
   Customer Order → Route Optimization → Vehicle Assignment → Delivery Execution
   ```

2. **Vehicle Communication Flow**

   ```
   Vehicle Telemetry → MQTT → Kafka → Processing → Storage/Analytics
   ```

3. **Notification Flow**
   ```
   Event Trigger → Notification Service → Multiple Channels (SMS/Email/Push)
   ```

## Security Architecture

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- API key management
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Regular security audits

## Monitoring & Observability

- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- Sentry for error tracking
- Custom dashboards for different stakeholders

## Scalability & Performance

- Microservices architecture
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Load balancing across services
- Caching with Redis
- Message queuing with Kafka
- CDN for static content

## Disaster Recovery

- Regular database backups
- Multi-region deployment
- Failover mechanisms
- Manual override capabilities
- Emergency contact system
- Incident response procedures

## Future Considerations

- Support for increased fleet size
- Integration with new technologies
- Enhanced AI/ML capabilities
- Improved route optimization
- Advanced predictive maintenance
- Expanded customer features
